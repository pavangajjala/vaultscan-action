**VaultScan GitHub Action** is a reusable GitHub Action that automatically scans your repository for secrets and credentials using the [VaultScan Community Edition](https://github.com/pavangajjala/vaultscan-community).

---

## 📌 Purpose

This action integrates VaultScan directly into your CI/CD pipeline to detect sensitive information (like AWS keys, Slack tokens, GitHub tokens, and private keys) in your codebase before it reaches production.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Create `.github/workflows/scan.yml` and paste:

```yaml
name: VaultScan Secrets Detection

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  vaultscan:
    name: Run VaultScan on Codebase
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run VaultScan via GitHub Action
        uses: pavangajjala/vaultscan-action@v1.2
